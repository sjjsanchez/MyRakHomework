## HOW TO SECURE YOUR WIFI NETWORK - page 2

**6. Turn on the security and encryption features for your network:**

Depending on your router, you may have additional security features. Enable firewall protection, intrusion detection, and any other security features your router offers.

**7. Cut Back on the Number of Devices:**

Some routers allow you to limit the number of devices that can connect to your network. Enabling this feature can help prevent unauthorized access.

**8. Reinstall router firmware to get it updated:**

Keep your router's firmware up to date. Manufacturers often release updates to fix security vulnerabilities.

**9. Disable Remote Administration:**

Turn off remote administration of your router unless you specifically need it. Allowing remote access can be a security risk.

**10. Use Guest Networks:**

If your router supports it, create a separate guest network for visitors. This network should have a different password, and guests should not have access to your main network.
