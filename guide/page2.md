## HOW TO SECURE YOUR WI-FI NETWORK - page 3

**11. MAC Address Filtering:**

You can configure your router to only allow specific devices (identified by their MAC addresses) to connect to the network. While this can enhance security, it can be cumbersome to manage.

**12. Regularly Check Connected Devices:**

Periodically review the list of devices connected to your network. Disconnect any unfamiliar devices.

**13. Educate Yourself and Your Family:**

Educate everyone in your household about the importance of Wi-Fi security. Ensure they understand not to share the Wi-Fi password with strangers.

**14. Physical Security:**

Physically secure your router in a location that is not easily accessible to unauthorized individuals.

**15. Use a Strong Administrator Password:**

Change the default administrator password for your router. This is different from the Wi-Fi network password and is used to access the router's settings.

**16. Regularly Monitor Network Activity:**

Use network monitoring tools or your router's logs to keep an eye on network activity. Look for any suspicious or unauthorized connections.

**17. Consider VPNs for Added Security:**

If you require an extra layer of security, consider setting up a Virtual Private Network (VPN) for your network. A VPN encrypts all data transmitted over the network.

By following these steps, you can significantly enhance the security of your Wi-Fi network and reduce the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches. Keep in mind that security is an ongoing process, and it's important to stay vigilant and update your security measures as needed.
