## HOW TO SECURE YOUR WI-FI NETWORK

Wi-Fi is already widely used, especially during the pandemic when most work was done remotely. As a result, it is essential to secure the Wi-Fi network to prevent illegal access, to safeguard your data, and to ensure network privacy. Below are the measures that will assist you in ensuring the security of your WiFi network:

**1. Modify the Default Router Login Information:**

Your router's default username and password should be changed as one of the first things you do. It is often neglected since they are well-known.

**2. Switch on WPA3 encryption:**

Use the latest Wi-Fi encryption standard, which as of my last update is WPA3. Older standards like WEP and WPA2 are less secure and vulnerable to attacks. Set a strong Wi-Fi passphrase (password).

**3. Modify the Network Name (SSID):**

Rename your Wi-Fi network to something unique that doesn't reveal your identity or personal information. Avoid using default or common names.

**4. Hide SSID (Optional):**

While this doesn't provide strong security by itself, it can help deter casual attackers. You can choose to hide your SSID so that it doesn't appear in the list of available networks. However, determined attackers can still find a hidden SSID.

**5. Utilize a Secure Password:**

Use a strong, complex password for your Wi-Fi network. A strong password includes a mix of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters. Avoid easily guessable passwords like "password123."
